# Camera2 samples

This is a catalog of camera2-specific APIs to demonstrate the usage and capabilities of the API.

- [Camera Preview]():
  Demonstrates displaying processed pixel data directly from the camera sensor to the screen using Camera2.
- [Image Capture]():
  Demonstrates how to capture an image using Camera2 and encode it into a JPEG container.
- [UltraHDR Image Capture]():
  Demonstrates how to capture a 10-bit compressed still image and store it using the new UltraHDR image format using Camera2.

> 🚧 **Work-in-Progress:** we are working on brining more existing and new samples for camera2, and soon, CameraX as well
