# Android Platform Samples

This repository contains a collection of samples that demonstrate the use of different Android OS platform APIs. The samples are organized into folders by topic, and each folder contains a README file that provides more information about the samples in that folder.

> **Note:** These samples are intended to showcase specific functionality in isolation, and they may use
> simplified code. They are not intended to be used as production-ready code.
> For best practices follow our documentation and check
> [Now In Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid)

- More to come...

We are constantly adding new samples to this repository. You can find a list of all the available samples [here](https://github.com/android/platform-samples/tree/main/samples/README.md).

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the whole project in Android Studio.
3. Sync & Run `app` configuration

The app will open with the samples list screen that allows you to navigate throughout the different
categories and available samples.

> **Note:** the `app` module is required to bring together all the samples but it's not relevant
> for their functionality, you can simply ignore it. The wiring is done under the hood and an
> implementation detail not needed to understand any sample functionality.

### Deeplink to sample

To open a specific sample directly you can use one of the auto-generated configurations.

1. Build the project at least once
2. Open `Run Configuration` dropdown
3. Select sample name
4. Run

> **Tip:** use `⌃⌥R` or `Alt+Shift+F10` shortcut to open the full list and launch the selected one.
